# TODO: build from harvester code
# upon spawn find yourself a container that you should sit on, reserve it in memory
# if you are not sitting on a designated container, go and sit on one
# if you are sitting on it, check if the source is empty, if it's not, hammer it
# if the source is empty and there is another non-reserved source in that room that can be reached before our current source resets, then switch designated source to that new one and go to it
# if all sources are empty and we can reach spawn before sources reset + our spawning time, go to the spawn
# if you are at the spawn, decide whether to recycle itself or renew itself
